# Tourist 

The Tourist App which I developed by using Swift downloads images from Flickr API. The app allows users to drop pins on a map. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location.
A map is shown where you can long press the location you want, which will make the app add a pin at that location. Tapping the pin will show a view where random photos will appear that are related with that location. Pins will be stored using Core Data.
